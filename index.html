            <ul class="py-4">
               <p> Sindhutai Sapkal was born on 14 November 1948,[1] in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district in the then Central Provinces and Berar of British India to Abhimanyu Sathe, a cowherder.[2][3] Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as Chindhi (Marathi for "torn piece of cloth"). Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early marriage forced her to quit formal education after she successfully passed the fourth standard.[4] Sapkal was married off at age 12 to Shrihari Sapkal, who was 20 years elder to her, and moved to Nawargaon village, Seloo in Wardha.[5] The marriage did not last long and at the age of 20,[5] she was left on her own to care for a girl child.[6][3][7] </p>

            <ul class="py-4">
               <p>Sindhutai Sapkal later found herself in Chikhaldara, where she started begging on railway platforms for food. In the process, she realised that there were many children abandoned by their parents and she adopted them as her own. She then begged more vigorously to feed them. She decided to become a mother to everyone who came across to her as an orphan. She later donated her biological child to the trust Shrimant Dagdu Sheth Halwai, Pune, to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her biological child and the adopted children.[8][9]

                Details of Sapkal's struggle were provided in the weekly Optimist Citizen on 18 May 2016:
                
                In this constant tussle to survive, she found herself in Chikaldara, situated in the Amravati district of Maharashtra. Here, due to a tiger preservation project, 84 tribal villages were evacuated. Amidst the confusion, a project officer impounded 132 cows of Adivasi villagers and one of the cows died. Sapkal decided to fight for proper rehabilitation of the helpless tribal villagers. Her efforts were acknowledged by the Minister of Forests and he made appropriate arrangements for alternative relocation.[10]</p>>

                <ul class="py-4">
                   <p>Sapkal devoted herself to orphans. As a result, she was fondly called "Mai", which means "mother". She nurtured over 1,500 orphaned children and through them had a grand family of 382 sons-in-law and 49 daughters-in-law. She has been honoured with more than 700 awards for her work. She used award money to buy land to make a home for orphaned children.[12][13]
